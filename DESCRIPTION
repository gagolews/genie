Description: A new hierarchical clustering linkage
    criterion: the algorithm links two clusters in such a way that a chosen
    economic inequity measure (e.g., the Gini index) of the cluster
    sizes does not increase drastically above a given threshold. Benchmarks
    indicate a high practical usefulness of the introduced method:
    it most often outperforms the Ward or average linkage in terms of
    the clustering quality while retaining the single linkage speed.
